{"name":"BeotsMusic","tagline":"Standalone Mac OS X browser for Beats Music","body":"## What's BeotsMusic?\r\n\r\nBeotsMusic is a Mac OS X application which brings __[Beats Music](http://beatsmusic.com)__ to the desktop without using a browser.\r\n\r\n### Why is that good?\r\n\r\n- No more 'trying to find in which tab is __Beats Music__ running'..\r\n- Media keys support! (Yeah, those with ▶ ❚❚ on them.)\r\n- Stops on suspend.\r\n\r\n### BeotsMusic is a weird name. How to pronounce it?\r\n\r\nI don't know, but you can get a clue from [SoundCleod](https://soundcloud.com/senart/soundcleod).\r\n\r\n## How to get it?\r\n\r\n- [Download the latest from here.](https://github.com/kiding/beotsmusic/releases)\r\n- Double click the file.\r\n- Drag BeotsMusic into your Applications folder.\r\n- Go to Applications, double click BeotsMusic.\r\n- Optionally drag BeotsMusic from Applications into the Dock.\r\n\r\n**Important!** Minimum required OSX version is 10.7 (Lion).\r\n\r\n## Screenshots? Yeah!\r\n\r\n![BeotsMusic screenshot](https://raw.github.com/kiding/beotsmusic/master/screenshot.png)\r\n\r\n## Alternatives\r\n- Any modern web browser\r\n- [BeardedSpice](http://beardedspice.com/) (Mac)\r\n\r\n## Disclaimer\r\n\r\n__Beats Music__ doesn't support keyboard shortcuts unlike SoundCloud. That means, the method being used here is a bit more hackery than the predecessor, [SoundCleod](https://github.com/salomvary/soundcleod).\r\n\r\nUse at your own _higher_ risk. It might destroy the Earth. Or better don't use it.\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\n__Forked by__ [Dongsung \"Don\" Kim](http://kiding.net)\r\n\r\n__Created by__ [Márton Salomváry](https://twitter.com/salomvary)\r\n\r\nand [SoundCleod contributors](https://github.com/salomvary/soundcleod/graphs/contributors)","google":"UA-34035197-4","note":"Don't delete this file!
